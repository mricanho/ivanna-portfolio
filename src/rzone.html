              To begin our analysis phase we made a competitive analysis where we compared Rzone to its main competitors. We wanted <span class="black_volt"> insight into how was the competition doing things compared to Rzone</span> and how could we upgrade in general. <br><br>

              Our findings were that compared to the competition <span class="black_volt">Rzone´s website had more information than necessary</span> and that it was the only website that<span class="black_volt"> did not have an account section for users.</span>

                We found out that even though Rzone has great customer service and technology inside the gym, <span class="black_volt"> their communication through the website has information that is misleading accidentally confusing customers</span> and potential clients who could decide to leave to a different gym if the information given kept on being overwhelming and confusing.<span class="black_volt"> Having a loaded website felt intimidating and not very friendly.</span>

            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Clarissa is an older woman who is not a fan of the gym but would like to start exercising. She feels that <span class="black_volt"> an organized group class could motivate her to exercise</span> and she is willing  to try. She has ideas of where she could go by searching on Google and walking around her area. As an accountant, Clarissa works from home and would like to find a place that <span class="black_volt"> would get her out of her house and feel a sense of community somewhere.</span></p>
            <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <p>
              · Easy access to the main information about the Gym. <br>
              ·  Quick first time registration process.<br>
              · Accesible ways to register for class may that be the app or the web.
            </p>
            <h3>FRUSTRATION</h3>
            <p>
              · Getting confused due to too much info at the web page.<br>
              · Getting lost while navigating the site.<br>
              · Not knowing which gym would be better for her.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Due to her busy schedule <span class="black_volt">she would like to have quick access to information </span>about the nearest studios however she feels an all ladies gym would be best; it would make her feel more comfortable. <br><br>

            To better understand her pain points we made a <span class="black_volt">journey map</span> explaining the beginning and end of her experience looking for the perfect studio to exercise.

            <h2>JOURNEY MAP</h2>
            <p>
            1. She begins by wanting to go to a gym to feel healthier and to get out of the house. <br><br>
            2.  She soon realises how uncomfortable she would be excersicing in front of men. <br><br>
            3. She finds Rzone she gets excited and decides to navigate through the web.<br><br>
            4. She soon finds out the current page is overwhelming in information she wont have time to look at but decides to trust the gym anyway and decides to schedule her first visit. <br><br>
            5. As she´s looking to register she notices there isn't an account option and that the registration process is made in stages where you have to fill a form, then the studio has to approve it and later on call you to see if you´re still interested. <br><br>
            6. Due to this process that seems exhausting she moves on.

            <span class="black_volt">The about page now shows through videos and images the most relevant features the gym provides.</span> It is all in one page and a little explanation is added. <br><br>

          <p>For the studios, we noticed information was misleading so we decided to have<span class="black_volt"> one page where users could access to basic information like area, description and an image of the facilities.</span> From here they can book a free class that would take them to the<span class="black_volt"> newly added registration page</span> or by clicking on the<span class="black_volt"> studio image a page dedicated to that specific studio where users can access schedules, packages</span> and a link to the studio´s instagram.</p>

            Once the user clicks on “book free class” it would take them to the<span class="black_volt"> log in/ registration page where they can create a new account </span>or access their account if they´re current clients.

            After registration the new user would have<span class="black_volt"> access to an account that provides them with necessary information,</span> automatizing the process of registration to a new gym as well as general contact with the front desk.

            Through the new interface<span class="black_volt"> the goal of enhancing the website by simplifying and categorizing the information was met.</span> Through it, users will satisfy their needs creating loyalty and elevating Rzone´s reputation through seamless user experience.
