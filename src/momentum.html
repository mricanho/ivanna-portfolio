         <h2>MOOD BOARD</h2>
         <p>
           Once the main features and topics were stated we moved on to creating a <span class="black_volt"> visual style for our brand.</span> We made a mood board that would transmit the energy of our site and through it create our branding.

           <p>
             Through a style tile, we were able to <span class="black_volt"> define specific aspects of our site as well as our branding.</span> <br><br>

              To begin we came up with the name & logo.

            <img src="../assets/images/horizontal.png" alt="">
            <p>
            We believed the name was the perfect fit for Elaine´s situation. <span class="black_volt"> Momentum- to be in the moment. We would like for her to be able to unwind and be present.</span>

            Then we continued creating the <span class="black_volt font_size: higth"></span> <span>Style tile </span> where colors, typography and components that would be essential to our site.

        <h3>LOW-FI</h3>
        <p>To begin our interface design, we each made a low-fi of how we thought the site should look. <span class="black-volt"> We then chose the best features and components </span>combining our designs to create the look of our final low-fi.</p>

        <p>
          Our goal was to create a <span class="black_volt"> desktop interface that helped Elaine multitask.</span> To achieve this we created different ways to intake the content and we prioritized it through seamless organization. <br><br>

          We added<span class="black_volt">videos at the top of every article </span>that would summarize the article because we believe that<span class="black_volt"> visual communication is the quickest and strongest form to process new information.</span> This would save her a lot of time and it would allow her to multitask. <br><br>

          Then we added an <span class="black_volt"> audio play feature</span> where in case she wanted to understand the content better but couldn't sit down to read she could listen to the whole article.<br><br>

          Then before the article she could find <span class="black_volt">bullet points highlighting the most important aspects of the article.</span> <br><br>

          And finally the full article to be read.<br><br>

          The idea was to organize the content<span class="black_volt">  from top to bottom- quickest to slowest.</span>

          <h3>MID-FI</h3>

            Once we had our design set moving to our mid-fi was fairly easy. Because we started with out desktop design, creating the tablet and phone was a smooth process of reacommodating the components while respecting the main design. <br><br>

          <span class="black_volt"> We tried to make our responsive sites as simple as possible to ease time usage.  </span>
